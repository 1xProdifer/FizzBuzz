# FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is a fun and easy game to write in code. Hereâ€™s what you do: count from 1 to 100, and for each number:

- Print "Fizz" if the number can be divided by 3.
- Print "Buzz" if the number can be divided by 5.
- Print "FizzBuzz" if the number can be divided by both 3 and 5.

If the number cannot be divided by 3 or 5, just print the number itself.
